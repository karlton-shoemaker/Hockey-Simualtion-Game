# Hockey-Simulation-Game

This project was created as one of my first assignments at We Can Code IT software bootcamp. The challenge was basically just to create a class from scratch and then use it a few times in the program class, but I wanted to push myself, so I ended up making three classes and creating a simple text-based Hockey Game with the below options.

## 1. Shoot a Goal
A list of players will be displayed and then you can select one to take a shot and choose to keep shooting as long as you want. You might get penalized though, and your player will no longer be able to take shots until their time in the penalty box is served.

## 2. Defend a Shot
You can choose from a list of goalies and defensemen to try to prevent the other team from scoring. 

## 3. Start a Fight
What's a hockey game without fighting? You can pick a player to fight with and choose your opponent. Win or lose though, you're still spending time in the penalty box.

## 4. Serve Time in the Penalty Box
If you choose this option, whichever player you select will immediately have their penalty time reset to zero and will be available for the next action. Otherwise each minute of penalty time will decrease as the menu is refreshed to take the next action.

## 5. Create a Player
Name a player yourself and have them do all of the actions listed above!
